					<h2>What is Cyber-Lane?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						Cyber-Lane started in 2001 by Justin Nel, and is his personal technology playground, where
						all of his experiments and projects are brought together for everybody to see.
					</div>
					<h2>Who is Justin Nel?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						Justin Nel is an engineer, many years of experience in developing varied solutions, for
						multiple platforms. He has done work for the military, large international corporate companies,
						education systems, as well as a number of projects for small and medium sized companies.
						Although currently based in England, Justin has been involved in projects in Japan, Barbados,
						Texas and a number of other international locations. His long term goals are to move to
						America, primarily developing systems which interface with and interrogate complex data systems.
					</div>
					<h2>Which platforms?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						This is ever changing, as Justin will always be more than happy to take on a challenge
						and learn how a new system works, so that he can develop code for it. A brief sample of
						some of the systems that he has developed for includes: Windows, Linux, Gameboy Advanced,
						Windows Mobile, as well as a number of completely custom hardware systems, which do not
						run regular Operating Systems.
					</div>
					<h2>What type of hobbies does he have?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						Well other than the regular ones such as reading science fiction books and movies, Justin
						spends a lot of his time playing with electronics, developing automation systems,
						reverse engineering systems to see how they work, or inventing. He is a proud member of the
						<a href="http://www.buildbrighton.com">Build Brighton Makerspace</a>, and when the weather is
						good, he invests time in building an electric motorcycle he designed.
